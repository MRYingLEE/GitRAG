# Pandas Changelog: Version 1.5.3 to 2.2.2  
   
## New Features  
   
### Version 2.0.0  
   
- **Nullable Boolean Data Type**: Introduced support for the nullable boolean data type (\`pd.BooleanDtype\`). This allows for better handling of missing values in boolean columns.  
   
- **Improved JSON Handling**: Added support for reading and writing JSON files with orient='table' using the \`DataFrame.to_json()\` and \`pd.read_json()\` methods.  
   
### Version 2.1.0  
   
- **Enhanced Arrow Integration**: Improved integration with Apache Arrow. Added support for converting DataFrames to Arrow tables using \`DataFrame.to_arrow()\` and from Arrow tables using \`pd.read_arrow()\`.  
   
- **String Methods Update**: New string methods \`str.removeprefix()\` and \`str.removesuffix()\` have been introduced, aligning with Python 3.9 string handling.  
   
### Version 2.2.0  
   
- **Datetime Improvements**: Added support for \`pd.Timedelta\` to be used in \`groupby()\` operations, allowing for enhanced time-based grouping.  
   
- **New Window Functionality**: Introduced \`expanding()\` method for DataFrames, similar to \`rolling()\`, but expanding window functionality is now more flexible with additional options.  
   
## Enhancements  
   
### Version 2.0.0  
   
- **Enhanced MultiIndex Handling**: Improvements in handling MultiIndexes, including better performance and more intuitive index manipulation methods.  
   
- **Error Messaging**: Improved error messages across various methods for better debugging and development.  
   
### Version 2.1.0  
   
- **Performance Improvements in IO**: Enhanced performance for reading and writing CSV and Parquet files, making data I/O more efficient.  
   
### Version 2.2.0  
   
- **GroupBy Enhancements**: Optimized \`groupby()\` operations for better performance, particularly with large datasets.  
   
## API Changes  
   
### Version 2.0.0  
   
- **Deprecation of Panel**: The \`Panel\` data structure has been fully removed. Users are encouraged to use MultiIndex DataFrames or xarray for 3-dimensional data.  
   
- **Changes to \`read_html()\`**: The \`read_html()\` function has been updated to use \`lxml\` by default for parsing HTML. Users can still specify \`bs4\` if preferred.  
   
### Version 2.2.0  
   
- **Index Renaming**: The method \`rename_axis()\` now raises a TypeError if the new axis name is not hashable.  
   
- **\`DataFrame.append()\` Deprecation**: The \`DataFrame.append()\` method is now deprecated in favor of using \`concat()\`, as it offers better performance and more flexibility.  
   
## Summary  
   
These updates from Pandas 1.5.3 to 2.2.2 include significant enhancements in data handling, especially with new data types and improved IO performance. Users should also be aware of API changes and deprecated features to ensure smooth transitions in their codebases.
